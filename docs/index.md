## Joe Saccente's ePortfolio 

Hello,

This ePortfolio consists of a single project which aims to showcase my ability to develop a concept into a complete and running application.  The game of Farkle (first to 10,000) within makes use of skills gathered throughout my CS degree and showcases my ability to put them to use.  The application is written entirely in python, has a functional GUI, connects to a local database for storing winners and provides an AI opponent.  

Thank you for taking the time to take a look.
